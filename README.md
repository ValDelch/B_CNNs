# Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks
 
This repository contains an implementation of Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks, as used in the paper: Valentin Delchevalerie, Alexandre Mayer, Adrien Bibal and Benoît Frénay. "SO(2) and O(2) Equivariance in Image Recognition with B-CNNs." (submitted to JMLR 04/23, in review).

A notebook can be found in the "Examples" directory. It shows simple examples on how to use the implementation.
