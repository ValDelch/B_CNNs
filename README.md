# Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks
 
This repository contains an implementation of Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks, as used in the paper: Valentin Delchevalerie, Alexandre Mayer, Adrien Bibal and Benoît Frénay. "SO(2) and O(2) Equivariance in Image Recognition with Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks." (submitted to JMLR 04/23, in review).

Preprint can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09214

A notebook can be found in the "Examples" directory. It shows simple examples on how to use the implementation.
